In this busy world, finding time is hard and corporations take advantage of this lack of time by charging you on a monthly basis. CrypTV provides a pay-as-you-watch functionality along with easy streaming license management using NFT derivative of the movies, which is linked to a media NFT share market. 

For Consumers:
1. On Average a person watches around 4 hours of television per day but all the current streaming platforms charge you on a daily/monthly basis. This means you end up paying for more than what you are consuming.
2. All the major platforms charge you by showing their huge amount of video library but how many can you actually watch in a lifetime? Why pay for things which you will never even get time to watch.
3. No crypto? We use Portis which means you can easily perform transactions even without being in the crypto ecosystem.

For Distributors:
1. We present an easy-to-manage streaming license management system. Each of the movies has its own NFT token and can be traded.
2. Revenue streams automatically get redirected if you buy/sell your streaming license.
